## Self-Study/Essay Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.

1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

- `describe()` is what holds a group of tests together, and within it, each test is singled out with the `it()` descriptions.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

- the point of TDD (Test Driven Development) is to make sure that your codebase is scalable. It helps you by making sure that your code is not only functional, but more bug-free when you try to add more features. I like this style of approach because it helps your project grow at an overall faster rate. You have less of a chance to break a previously functional feature when you add new ones.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

- Unit Testing
- Snapshot Testing
- End-to-End Testing
